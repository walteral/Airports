# Airports
Created by Alex Walters for GEOG572

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how interactive elements of a webpage can be created. To do this we showed where on a map airports are across the country. Each state is colored based on the number of airports within that state. Each icon is color coded by if it has a control tower or not. The state labels are dynamic, meaning that they won't cover each other. And when clicked on, the plane icons displays the name of that airport. 

Libraries used: Leaflet, Ajax, font awesome, google fonts, label gun, chroma, graditcle, jquery

Data: all data was provided by Bo Zhao

Acknowledgement: I would like to thank Bo Zhao and Jared Ritchey in helping me make this map. Without their continued support this dream would never have become a reality. Stay classy gentlemen.
